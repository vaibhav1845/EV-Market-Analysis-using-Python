# Market Size Analysis of Electric Vehicles (EVs)

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis of the electric vehicle (EV) market, including historical trends, forecasting, and insights derived from the data.



Market Size Analysis is the process of estimating the potential sales for a product or service within a particular market segment. In the context of electric vehicles (EVs), it involves assessing the total volume of EV registrations to understand the growth of the market, forecast future trends, and help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding production, infrastructure development, and policy-making.

## Dataset Overview

The provided dataset contains the following columns, each representing different aspects of the electric vehicle (EV) population in the United States:

- **VIN (1-10)**: Partial Vehicle Identification Number.
- **County**: The county in which the vehicle is registered.
- **City**: The city in which the vehicle is registered.
- **State**: The state in which the vehicle is registered. It appears that this dataset may be focused on Washington (WA) state.
- **Postal Code**: The postal code where the vehicle is registered.
- **Model Year**: The year of the vehicle model.
- **Make**: The manufacturer of the vehicle.
- **Model**: The model of the vehicle.
- **Electric Vehicle Type**: The type of electric vehicle, e.g., Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV).
- **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility**: Eligibility status for clean alternative fuel vehicle programs.
- **Electric Range**: The maximum range of the vehicle on a single charge (in miles).
- **Base MSRP**: The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price.
- **Legislative District**: The legislative district where the vehicle is registered.
- **DOL Vehicle ID**: Department of Licensing Vehicle Identification.
- **Vehicle Location**: Geographic coordinates of the vehicle location.
- **Electric Utility**: The electric utility service provider for the vehicle’s location.
- **2020 Census Tract**: The census tract for the vehicle’s location.
